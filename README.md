# DeconvRL
DeconvRL is a open source CUDA implementation of accelerated Richard-Lucy Deconvolution algorithm regularized with total variation loss. This library is developed to recovered blurred image due to the spreading of point source in optical system. As far as we know, there is no other fully functional open source GPU accelerated implementation. This project is aim to develope an open source, high efficient library to process high resolution images of high quality.

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
You need the following packages to get started.

***nix**
```
make
g++ <= 5
CMake >= 3.6
Boost >= 1.59
CUDA >= 8.0
```

**Windows**

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests
Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests
Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```
